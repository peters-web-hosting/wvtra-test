What we do
The Walbottle Village Tenants and Residents Association was founded in 2020 during Covid lockdown to bring relief to residents of Walbottle Village by encouraging a community spirit and assisting the most vulnerable members of the community.  The remit is expanding post lockdown to include a gardening club, a history group a food bank collection and organising social events which are open to all.  We pride ourselves in being fully inclusive, having minority groups on the committee.
